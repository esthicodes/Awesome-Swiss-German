Island Count

If your peer is stuck, ask them if they know how to traverse a undirected graph.

At this point, you peer may come up with a recursive solution by using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. 

While this works, see if you can nudge them toward an iterative solution. This is not a must, but preferable.


Make sure that your peer’s code does not access out of bound indices, especially when trying to traverse adjacent cells in binary Matrix.

Watch out for duplicate island counting in your peer’s code. 

It’s important that a visited cell of 1 is marked properly to avoid redundant counting.


Any solution that takes more than O(N⋅M) time isn’t optimal.
